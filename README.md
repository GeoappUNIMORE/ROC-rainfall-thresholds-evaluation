# ROC-rainfall-thresholds-evaluation
Data driven rainfall thresholds evaluation responsible to landslides acceleration events based on Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) method. It statistically asses cumulated precipitation thresholds that can provide early warning for the occurrence of events represented by the exceedance of rare displacement rates. It is based on displacement and rainfall timeseries.

Files description:
1. "ROC_threshold_evaluation.zip" R scripts to perform the ROC based evaluation of rainfall threshlds responsible for extreme velocities.

The rationale and a case study application is presented in: Corsini, A. & Mulas, M. Use of ROC Curves for Early Warning of Landslide Displacement Rates in Response to Precipitation (Piagneto Landslide, Northern Apennines, Italy).
